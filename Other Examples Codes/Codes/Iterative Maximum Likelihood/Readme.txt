QuickStart:

This is code to do iterative Maximum Likelihood estimation of a state from 
the measured current differences from a balanced homodyne tomography setup.

Add all included directories and subdirectories to the list of folders matlab will search for functions.

The main program is called Wigner.m in the "Wigner Function Code" directory
- documentation (format of data, etc.) is contained within the files.

An example of how to use Wigner.m is given in test.m - also documented.

One can feed test.m with monte carlo simulated data for a number of states, including
the zero Fock state, one Fock state, and displaced one Fock state. These data simulation matlab
files are in the "Monte Carlo for Test states" directory. Some of the results are presented in fig files 
and are in the "Test Results" directory and "Wigner Function Code" directory. These can be compared to theoretical
density matrices generated by various correspondinly named .m files in "Wigner Function Code".

At the moment reconstructions do not work if you include loss (ie detector efficiency) in the the POVMs 
in the iterative procedure. This is illustrated for the vacuum state in the "Test Results" directory.

Good luck and email me if you need tips.
